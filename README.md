FormulaToy
==========

Toy for exploring 3-d formulas. Supports 3 coordinate systems: cartesian, polar, cylindrical. Uses three.js

***NOTE: This project has been superceded by FormulaToy.v2. That is the code running FormulaToy.net, not this repo.    

This version has no server component, but a server component is required for the sharing functions, hence v2.
